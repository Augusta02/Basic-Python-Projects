 Write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.
 
 total_blocks =int(input("Enter the number of blocks:")
 blocks=0
 height=0
 
 while blocks in range(total_blocks):
       height+=1
       block+=1
       total_blocks-=blocks
       
 print("The height of the blocks:", height)
